	<h3>Who is Valeria?</h3>
	<p>As an ambitious media student, I strive to be the best version of myself personally and professionally. I enjoy working with people and organising the details of a project. It is important to me to make sure that everyone in the group feels welcomed and as a part of the group. I hope to develop my skills further by getting on track with my ambitions and work towards my goals.</p>

	<h3>Personality</h3>
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm">
<p><br><br>During my first year, I did the 16personalities test, which is a personality test based on Myers and Briggs personality theory.On the right side, you can see my results from previous year, and below my new results from this year and the difference is big.<br><br>
I have always struggled with "finding myself" and completed multiple personality tests that would hopefully give me the answer. I also learned that personality is said to be something that doesn't change overtime significantly. So , why are my results so different?<br><br>
Before, I used to identify myself as somebody who enjoys talking to people and meeting new friends. I think the biggest factor, of the results saying that I am now introverted more than extroverted, is the isolation in quarantine and being able to be as social as before. I am afraid that I will not be able to socialise or enjoy it the same way I did before. I have grown to live with less people around me and started to enjoy it more and more. However, after reading more into my Mediator role, I completely identify with this role in many detail.</p>

<h3>PCM Workshops</h3>
	<p>During semester 4, I completed three PCM workshops to get a deeper understanding of my development and use the results to improve myself and my possibilities for work placements. These workshops are Belbin, Leadership, and Personal Branding. From there workshops, I got results that helped me get a better grasp of my strengths and weaknesses. I found them very helpful, since my work placement is going to start on February 2022 and it is important to start searching already. Below you can see my brief reflections on the workshops and what I learned from them as well as the results linked.</p>
	<h4>Belbin</h4>
		<p>Last time I had completed my Belbin role test, it was the beginning of my BUas journey, 1.5 years ago. Looking back at my role as an Implementer then, the result hasn't changed much. The 360-test, with taking into consideratioin my answers and the answers from my observers, helped me understand my position better and what strengths and weaknesses I have. Although, my own answers said I am a Shaper and a Specialist, and my observers' answers said I was a Completer Finisher and a Teamworker, the 360-results concluded that my Belbin role is a Specialist and an Implementer.<br><br> From making this test, I can see that the Belbin roles can be distributed broadly. I think the most important lesson I learned from the test is that I am not as open-minded person as I thought I was. Knowing my stubborn abilities, I made sure to work on this goal during my first year of BUas, but I know now that there is more I can do to imrpove myself, and will also use this knowledge in next semester in my professional development. I believe this weakness can also be used for good. I am stubborn about the ways I work in, but when I know that something works well, I will use that knowledge wisely. I also learned a lot about my strengths. According to the Belbin test, I am determined and self-reliant and will make sure the work will be done on time. I definitely see the Belbin results as very complicated but extremely useful in an interview setting.</p>

	<h4>Leadership</h4>
		<p>After completing the Leadership workshop, I learned what type of leader I want to be and what I still need to do to work towards that leader. From the Belbin results, I realised even more what are my weaknesses and I believe I am able to work on that to become a better leader. It was interesting to reflect on questions like what kind of leader I am, want to be, and what I need to do to become that leader. During my second year at BUas, I took upon the role of producer in production house, which definitely pushed me to the right direction. I learned that I work great under pressure and it even inspires and motivates me.<br><br> As my goal is to one day be a producer or a manager, it is really important to reflect on my leadership and what can I do now to be the leader I want to be then. In the workshop, I mentioned that I want to have the courage to have more authority, but also to be aware of my team's progress and be an approachable leader. I want to make sure that the work atmosphere is pleasent for everyone. I also want to be able to inspire my team and I believe that it can be done by leading by example. This leadership philosophy is definitely what I believe in.</p>

	<h4>Personal Brand</h4>
		<p>The personal branding workshop was also very useful when it comes to networking and setting up a good resume for interviews. I learned more about what kind of words to use in an interview setting, how to sell myself, and how to make sure my LinkedIn profile is professional and appealing. For LinkedIn, I also found very useful a lecture that we had during our 4th semester at BUas.<br><br> My favourite part about the workshop was asking my peers about my brand attributes and core strengths. It was interesting to see what others thought about me and also very inspiring. My classmates told me that my brand attributes are that I am devoted, responsible, and empathetic, which were words I haven't heard before in describing myself. For core strengths, I got answers like balanced, self-reliant, project managing. These were not as surprising to me but definitely good to include in my descriptions in CV.</p>
