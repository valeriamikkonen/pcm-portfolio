	<h2>Professional Goals</h2><br>
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm">
	<h4>PA 2.2 PLANNING</h4>
<p>I often struggle with time management even though I constantly use my bullet journal -calendar and write all me meetings and tasks down. This is why I want to implement planning more into my schedule by dividing work into sections and this way keepig my concentration high.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm">
	<h4>PA 2.1 CREATIVITY</h4>
<p>During the past year, I have started writing down any small or big ideas I might have gotten. Now is the time to take these ideas into application and create some content. I want to get over my fear of publishing content and create something from scratch.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
	<h2>Leadership Goals</h2><br>
<div class="container">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm">
	<h4>PA 4.3 ACTIVE LISTENING</h4>
<p>In today's society, the frequent use of social media has destroyed people's ability to concentrate on something that is longer than 1 minute. I am also guilty of losing interest or concentration when listening to others. I want to practise this skill more by taking notes when others are talking, asking questions, and making eye-contact.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm">
	<h4>IA 1.4 PROBLEM SOLVING</h4>
<p>I often get comments that I seem like I know what I am doing, when in reality I am totally lost and don't know how to solve my problems. This is a skill that I want to learn to obtain and I believe it is possible by starting with asking help from others and reserching possible solutions online.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="reason">
	<h3>REASONS BEHIND GOALS</h3>
<p>I often want to be more organised even though my peers would tell me that I already am. After last semester trying to reflect on what is my level of feeling organised, I realised that the problem is in my ability to plan. This is why I chose to work on this goal in this semester. 
Creativity is something I always wanted to work on since I enjoy coming up with ideas but I often get scared when I actually have to create something and worry about others’ opinions on my work. I want to overcome this fear and create something that I would be proud of.
Coming to my leadership goals, I notice that I often stop paying attention in long conversations or lectures. This is a skills I want to work on. In addition to that I want to work on my problem solving skills and be able to provide good solutions for my team.</p>
</div>
<div class="proof">
<h3>PROOF ON MEETING GOALS</h3>
<p>My first goal was to start planning my time more. Above, you can find photos of my bullet journal (left) that I used to use monthly for planning. However, since December I have lacked using the bullet journal and in January I moved to use a shared digital calendar with my friend to motivate each other. This has become really helpful since we are not only keeping our school organised, but also keep each other motivated.
Another good implementation of this goal was my process of writing my academic essay: 
I first brainstormed on ideas to write about, selected the one that was most, interesting to me, made it more detailed, did research on the topic, wrote down every interesting point I found, created a base for my essay, wrote out the points, read through it and added more ideas, and did final grammar checks and got feedback from peers.
This process was very useful and didn’t feel overwhelming since I planned my work over a period of time.<br><br>
On my goal regarding creativity, I don’t have much proof since I didn’t have time, motivation, or inspiration to work on my creativity this semester. However, I always write down small ideas that could be little pieces of poetry, songs, or ideas for podcasts and short films on my phone. My short film note has been growing since the spring of 2020 and I like to write poems whenever I feel inspired. The poetry notes have been up since summer and have a collection of poems inside of them. </p>

	<h3>FEEDBACK ON PROFESSIONAL GOALS</h3>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm">
			<br><br><br><h4>SHOWING RESPONSIBILITY</h4>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm">
			<p>KEEP: Valeria is always willing to take on a task and never complained about having to do or redo her part of the project. I’ve never heard Valeria giving excuses or stress unnecessarily in front of the whole team, which shows she is very responsible when it comes to being serious and acting professionally.<br>
STOP: Holding yourself back if you are unsure if you can do something properly.<br>
START: Valeria always accepts work on top of work without people realising it. She needs to draw a line when she already has enough work on her plate. Valeria needs to be a bit more brave and take on new/more responsibilities. Valeria should start believing in herself more. She is capable of way more.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm">
			<br><br><br><h4>MEETING DEADLINES</h4>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm">
			<p>KEEP: Valeria never has missed a deadline. Valeria is always on time with everything regardless the work load. <br>
STOP: Pushing back some work and procrastinate.<br>
START: Send a message to let others know once she’s finished something. Get a habit of beginning something right away and finish it over time. Valeria could start taking interest in how far others are with their deadlines. Especially, if she decides to take up a role of a producer, it is important to stay connected with everyone.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm">
			<br><br><br><h4>MOTIVATING OTHERS</h4>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm">
			<p>KEEP: Valeria has a hardworking attitude that stimulates others to do the same thing. She is very devoted to the work she is doing. Valeria always shows a lot of empathy towards others and makes them feel safe and motivated by doing so. She would never lose her temper in a team or act unprofessionally. Her going outside in the rain to practice her camera skills motivates others as well.<br>
STOP: Being quiet in the meetings. Shutting yourself out when things are going wrong, try to speak your mind more often and be there for hard moments.<br>
START: Daring to say and contribute more to meetings as your opinion is valuable. Try to put more effort into making the team cohesive. This could really help with some difficult people in the team and would make you even more professional.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm">
			<br><br><br><h4>COORDINATING GROUPS AND TEAMS</h4>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm">
			<p>KEEP: Valeria makes a lot of effort for the project’s she’s working on
Having an overview of the group. Making sure that the task division is efficient, being an amazing teammate to work with and looking at the bigger picture.<br>
STOP: Holding yourself back or being shy. Don’t let your feelings take the best of you when it comes to work. It is good to take care of your mental health, whenever it is too much, but try to find a good balance between the two.<br>
START: Start talking a little more and daring to lead or coordinate the group when you see a solution. Valeria should try to take up the role of a producer. She could really do well in the role due to her great planning skills and it could really take her to the next level.</p>

		<div class="col-sm">
			<p>Valeria is mostly always present in the meetings and paying attention. However, she sometimes reacts less and could contribute more actively at times. When there is a problem in the team, Valeria tries to communicate it properly to sort things out. If something is important to bring up, she will think of a solution herself and then discuss it with the team.<br><br>- Christina Cordts (193808)</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm">
			<p>Valeria always listens to others, gives them space to express themselves and respects their opinion even when it differs from hers. She always provides really helpful feedback, going deeper than the surface and brings suggestions as well. Valeria always gives an answer and even if she is passively listening, she never ignores the person. Valeria never gives up when she has a problem to solve. She always thinks twice about what she says. Valeria always tries to avoid conflict and thus solves issues peacefully.<br><br>- Valeria Pavlic (192006)</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm">
			<p>Valeria listened to everybody in the team and took part in the conversation. She is open for all ideas and gives them a shot, which motivates others as well. If there is a problem she takes the responsibility in fixing it. Valeria is nice to work with.<br><br>- Amy Todorovski (191449)</p>

<div class="reflection">
	<h3>REFLECTION ON RECEIVED FEEDBACK</h3>
	<p>I think I definitely worked well on my planning goal this semester because I created a calendar with my friend (more in proof section) and I took advantage of separating my work into sections instead of doing everything at once. This can be seen in my process of writing the academic essay this semester which can we seen in my proof section as well. I am proud in my ability to achieve a work flow that satisfies my needs in learning.

My second goal was to create something and let my creativity out. However, I am not satisfied with my progress of this goal and I realised that this wasn’t the right choice for a goal to work on. I think creativity is something more free than planned and I liked to work on it with inspiration and not because I have to.

I noticed that I got a lot of feedback regarding me being active and social in meetings. I realised that I have gotten more quiet this semester, since I used to always be the one talking in the meetings and often leading the conversation. I don’t know what it is that has really affected this goal but I think that the pandemic has a lot to do with it. I really believe that I could contribute to the team more with communicating my progress and asking questions.</p>
</div>
	
<div class="next-semester">
	<h3>FOR NEXT SEMESTER</h3>
	<p>From receiving feedback this semester, I already have an idea of goals I want to set next semester. I will definitely take into consideration being more active in the meetings and contribute and put my effort into keeping the group more cohesive that way. In addition to setting a goal on my social and communication skills, I want to try out the producer role and take more responsibility in the group. I think this is a role that I have the abilities for but I often get lazy and pick the easiest task. I want to learn to take my so far learned skills, such as being organised and planning into more technical use and be able to work as a professional.</p>
